# SL.wrappers

This small `R` package adds to the functionality of the `SuperLearner` package. In particular, it implements additional wrapper functions for various machine learning algorithms in `R`.

The dependency `rlearner` is available on GitHub but not from CRAN. To install it from `xnie/rlearner`, use the command `devtools::install_github("xnie/rlearner")` or `remotes::install_github("xnie/rlearner")`.
